### Weixiang Yu's config files

A collection of configuration files to customize SciServer working environment.

- `git-completion.bash` & `git-prompt.sh`: Command line git autocompletion.
- `gitconfig_remote`: Git configuration file (change the settings under [user] to yours).
- `user-settings/`: JupyterLab settings, same as seen under `Settings -> Advanced Settings Editor`.
- `jupyter_notebook_config.py`: Jupyter notebook server settings, may not much needed within SciServer.
- `setup.sh`: Bash script configuring the computing environment using the above config files (mostly by soft links and copy).
